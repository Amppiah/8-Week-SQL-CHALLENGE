As a result of Danny's love for food, he decides to embark on a risky venture and invest in a restaurant
that serves his favorite meals: **Sushi**,**Ramen** and **Curry**. 
He has data from a few months of Operation and wants to use it to answer a few questions about the customers 
especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their
favourite .

Below are the questions Danny needed answers to :
- Wha is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by the customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers ?
- Which item was most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before they became a member?
- What is teh total items and amount spent for each memeber before they become a memeber?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier , how many points would each customer have?
- In the firts week after teh customer joins the program ( including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi- how many points do customer A and B have by the end of January?
