#CASE STUDY #1 : DANNY'S DINER

##You can have a closer look at the case study [Here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)
As a result of Danny's love for food, he decides to embark on a risky venture and invest in a restaurant
that serves his favorite meals: **Sushi**,**Ramen** and **Curry**. 
He has data from a few months of Operation and wants to use it to answer a few questions about the customers 
especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their
favourite .

#Below are the questions Danny needed answers to :

*What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
##How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
##What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
##What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
##Which item was the most popular for each customer?
##Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
##Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
##What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
##If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
##In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
