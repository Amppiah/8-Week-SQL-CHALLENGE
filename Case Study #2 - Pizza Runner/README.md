Danny has taken an interest in Pizza after a post from His instagram feed caught his attention ,
it was " 80s Retro Styling and Pizza in the Future" . Danny was sold on this idea but was not 
convince the pizza would provide enough funding so he decided to 'Uberize' it and recruited Runners
to assist. He also maxed out his credit cards as well to support the busines .
Danny being a Data scientist he knew the importance of collecting data and its importance to the 
growth of the business .
He has prepared an entity relationship diagram fo his database design but he requires some assistance in 
cleaning it for better quality and to perform calculations to better his runners and optimise the operations 
business .
